- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

Iâ€™m a passionate  software developer who aspires to work on
large scale projects, competitively learning new tech and
apply new skills whenever I can, Iâ€™m a fan of the Kanban
methodology which is a lean method to manage and improves
work across systems.

In regards to platform preference, I donâ€™t depend on a
particular platform since I am fine with developing on Mac
OSX, Windows 10, Chromebook, and any Linux variant. My
favorite of them all would have to be the Raspberry PI, I
like them for being robust, reasonably efficient, and being
able to fit in small places.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and
employ them on the spot; however, the most common programming
languages you will find me using most often is (`c`, `c++`,
`d` `python`, `kotlin`, `java`), not only that Iâ€™m open to
learning new skills on the spot.
