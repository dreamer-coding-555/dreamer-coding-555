- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

I am software developer that aspires to build unique applications,
tools, libraries, games, pretty much anything else as well. I have
found that solving puzzles is my forte as I love to solve problems
and provide solutions that may be novel, functional, and streamlined.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and employ
them on the spot; however, the most common programming languages you
will find me using most often is (`c`, `c++`, `cs`, `python`, `kotlin`,
`java`). I seem to have an affinity for learning new skills often as I
do sharing with others.

In regards to platform preference, I don‚Äôt really depend on a particular
platform since I am fine with developing on **Mac OS**, **Windows 10**,
**Chromebook**, and any **Linux** variant. My favorite of them all would
have to the **Raspberry PI**, I like them for being robust, reasonably
efficient, and being able to fit in small places.

I also do photography which is helpful because I can create assets for
any of my software projects and it is relaxing.
