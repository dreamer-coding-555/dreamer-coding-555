- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

Iâ€™m a fan of the Kanban methodology which is a lean method
to manage and improve work across human systems. This
approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with
available capacity, and by improving the handling of
system-level bottlenecks. Work items are visualized to
give participants a view of progress and process, from
start to finishâ€”usually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled
as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the
process when requested.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and
employ them on the spot; however, the most common programming
languages you will find me using most often is (`c`, `c++`,
`cs` `python`, `kotlin`, `java`), not only that Iâ€™m open to
learning new skills on the spot.

For fun I like solve problems because I found that solving puzzles
is my forte as I love to solve problems and provide solutions that
may be novel, functional, and streamlined, my favorite site to solve
problems on is HackerRank. Another fun thing I like to do is run a
fun little organization pipeline weâ€™re applications are implemented
with features concealed in there own modules, libraries are stored
in the [Miok modules](https://github.com/miok-modules) while
applications are in the [Miok](https://github.com/miok-hub)
project.

In regards to platform preference, I donâ€™t depend on a particular
platform since I am fine with developing on Mac OS, Windows 10,
Chromebook, and any Linux variant. My favorite of them all would
have to be the Raspberry PI, I like them for being robust, reasonably
efficient, and being able to fit in small places.
