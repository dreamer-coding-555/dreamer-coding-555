- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

I work at an Amazon fulfillment center as a Amazon learning
ambassador where I am maintaining expert-level knowledge in
all production departments; evaluate and improves processes
within work areas; refine learning tools and techniques across
the fulfillment center; assists in measuring the effectiveness
of learning; measure impact of development efforts; improve
associates‚Äô job-related skills. As a warehouse associate I am
packing boxes for shipment, sorting items into chutes, clearing
jammed conveyor belts, and water spidering supplies to all of
the packers.

When I'm not doing that I'm working on my software development
since I aspire to build unique applications, tools, libraries,
pretty much anything else as well. I have found that solving
puzzles is my forte as I love to solve problems and provide
solutions that may be novel, functional, and streamlined.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and
employ them on the spot; however, the most common programming
languages you will find me using most often is (`c`, `c++`,
`python`, `kotlin`, `java`). In regards to platform preference,
I don‚Äôt depend on a particular platform since I am fine with
developing on Mac OS, Windows 10, Chromebook, and any Linux
variant. My favorite of them all would have to be the
Raspberry PI, I like them for being robust, reasonably efficient,
and being able to fit in small places.
