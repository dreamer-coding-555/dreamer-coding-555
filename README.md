- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

I'm a Software Engineer, Photographer, Architect, and Technical Writer.


For a long time, I always believed there is nothing more painful than not
asking questions because when you don’t ask a question or pretend like you
know everything you’re only hurting yourself in the long run making yourself
incapable of absorbing new information. It doesn’t matter whether you have
been doing development for years or just starting and just happened to be
afraid the experts looking down upon your stupid questions the important
thing is that no one can know everything in all of the universe so be sure
to ask questions and learn about things as you go.

Fun fact there are no stupid questions so ask away and feel no shame. Asking
questions is what makes people successful not only in software development
but in any career path they choose.

I like writing about technical stuff usually but sometimes I write something
that both intuitively deep and meaningful. Learning through experimental work.
Doesn't hurt to try new things.
