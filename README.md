- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dreamer Gene Ridge Brockus you can call me Dreamer.

## About

I'm an aspiring software engineer that enjoys following a set of best
practices that combines software development and IT operations into
one streamlined system. What I like about it is that it aims to shorten
the development life cycle and provide a continuous delivery with
high-quality software.

I am actively designing, building, and monitoring the health of (`c`,
`c++`, `c#`,Â `python`) applications to ensure that customers get a
functional, robust, secure product out of the box so users don't end
up being frustrated and leaving to find something else.

Iâ€™m a passionate team-oriented, software developer who aspires to work
on large-scale projects, learning new technologies, applying new skills
and best practices whenever I can. The programming language I like to
use the most is c++ because I like a challenge.
