- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Gene Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

I'm an aspiring DevOps engineer that enjoys following a set of best
practices that combines software development and IT operations into
one streamlined system. What I like about it is that it aims to
shorten the development life cycle and provide a continuous delivery
with high quality software.

I am actively designing, building and monitoring the health of (`c`,
`c++`, `c#`, `python`) applications to assure that customers get
functional, robust, secure product out of the box so users don't end
up being frustrated and leaving to find something else.

Iâ€™m a passionate team oriented, software developer who aspires to work on
large-scale projects, learning new technologies, applying new skills and best
practices whenever I can. The programming languages I like to use the most is
`c++` becuase I like a challenge.
