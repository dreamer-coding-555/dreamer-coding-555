- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Gene Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

Iâ€™m a passionate, team oriented, software developer
who aspires to work on large scale projects, learning
new tech and applying new skills whenever I can. Iâ€™m
a fan of the Kanban methodology which is a lean method
to manage and improves work across systems.

I have developed on MacOS, Linux, Windows, Chromebook
as well as Raspberry PI. I like Raspberry PI a lot as
it is robust, reasonably efficient and small.
