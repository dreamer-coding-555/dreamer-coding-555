- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Brockus you can call me Mike.

## About

I work at an Amazon fulfillment center as a Amazon
learning ambassador where I am maintaining expert-level
knowledge in all production departments; evaluate and
improves processes within work areas; refine learning
tools and techniques across the fulfillment center;
assists in measuring the effectiveness of learning;
measure impact of development efforts; improve associatesâ€™
job-related skills. As a warehouse associate I am packing
boxes for shipment, sorting items into chutes, clearing
jammed conveyor belts, and water spidering supplies to
all of the packers.

Iâ€™m a fan of the Kanban methodology which is a lean method
to manage and improve work across human systems. This
approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with
available capacity, and by improving the handling of
system-level bottlenecks. Work items are visualized to
give participants a view of progress and process, from
start to finishâ€”usually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled
as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the
process when requested.

I am familiar with a vast range of programming languages and
employ them on the spot; however, the most common programming
languages you will find me using most often is (`c`, `c++`,
`cs` `python`, `kotlin`, `java`), not only that Iâ€™m open to
learning new skills on the spot.

For fun I like solve problems because I found that solving
puzzles is my forte as I love to solve problems and provide
solutions that may be novel, functional, and streamlined. My
favorite site to solve problems on is HackerRank.

In regards to platform preference, I donâ€™t depend on a particular
platform since I am fine with developing on Mac OS, Windows 10,
Chromebook, and any Linux variant. My favorite of them all would
have to be the Raspberry PI, I like them for being robust, reasonably
efficient, and being able to fit in small places.
